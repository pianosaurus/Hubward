Global:
  Add license statements where relevant.
  Add try blocks at decent places. We want to finish rendering even if
  a chunk fails. Just print a warning.
  Add verbose output. The option does nothing now.



NBT class: Add seek functions, and set up renderers to report their
  needed named tags. That way, the NBT reader can skip past unneeded
  tags, saving memory and hopefully increase speed.

intstring: Put base36 conversions here.


Planned features:
  Oblique mode is well underway in Pianosaurus's private repo.
  Location-based annotations to worlds.
  Sign-based annotations.
  Qt GUI.
  Windows installer based on NSIS.
  Save some PNG metadata:
    Annotated locations
    Image coordinates of position 0,0
    World coordinates of top right image corner
    Complete options string used to render
  Overlays:
    Explored caves overlay (based on torches and lack of daylight).
    Contour lines.
    Outline (where occlusion starts).
    Tree symbols.
    Parchment background.
