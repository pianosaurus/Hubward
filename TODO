Global: Add license statements where relevant.



NBT class: Add seek functions, and set up renderers to report their
  needed named tags. That way, the NBT reader can skip past unneeded
  tags, saving memory and hopefully increase speed.




Planned features:
  Oblique mode is well underway in Pianosaurus's private repo.
  Location-based annotations to worlds.
  Sign-based annotations.
  Qt GUI.
  Windows installer based on NSIS.
  Overlays:
    Explored caves overlay (based on torches and lack of daylight).
    Contour lines.
    Outline (where occlusion starts).
    Replace trees with a tree symbol.
    Parchment background.
