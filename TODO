Global: Add GPL(2?) statements where relevant.

NBT: Add seek functions, and set up renderers to report their needed
  named tags. That way, the NBT reader can skip past unneeded tags,
  saving memory and hopefully increase speed.

Level: If no chunks are ready to be rendered, but loading is still in
  progress, give up a timeslice. There is no need to run all cores at
  100 %.
