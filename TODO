Global:
  Add license statements where relevant.
  Create a man page.


NBT: Add seek functions, and set up renderers to report their
  needed named tags. That way, the NBT reader can skip past unneeded
  tags, saving memory and hopefully increase speed.

Renderer: Back to front rendering is a bit ugly on transparent
  surfaces like water (try oblique facing south or west). Probably
  a rounding error.

intstring: Put base36 conversions here.



Planned features:
  Ordinal oblique mode is well underway in Pianosaurus's private repo.
  Location-based annotations to worlds.
  Sign-based annotations.
  Qt GUI.
  Windows installer based on NSIS.
  Statistics (CSV-format).
  Save some PNG metadata:
    Annotated locations
    Image coordinates of position 0,0
    World coordinates of top right image corner
    Complete options string used to render
  Overlays:
    Explored caves overlay (based on torches and lack of daylight).
    Outline (where occlusion starts).
    Tree symbols.
    Parchment background.
    Read from PNG files (for compass roses, etc.)
    Grid (customisable z, x and y size and offset)
  Support for isopleth overlays.
  Contour overlay:
    Add customisable delta.
    Add customisable colour gradient in the y direction.
