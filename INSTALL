MineDraft installation notes:
-----------------------------

This package depends on
  zlib    (tested with 1.2.3)
  libpng  (tested with 1.4.3)

You may need the -dev or -devel versions, as building it from
source requires the availability of the library header files.


To build it, run (as regular user):
  ./configure
  make

The binary can be found in the src/ subdirectory.



Building from repository:
-------------------------

If you got this source directly from the repository, you
will need to generate the build scripts first. This requires
autotools.

To set up the build environment, run:
  aclocal
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf

Then follow the regular procedure.
